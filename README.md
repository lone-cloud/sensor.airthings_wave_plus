This repo is a custom component for home assistant. It will enable airthings wave devices to work with the latest versions of home assistant.

This repo is not meant for the public and is still undergoing a re-write. It's public in order to be accessible through HACS.

Should it ever be finished, it may be advertised, but don't count on it.
